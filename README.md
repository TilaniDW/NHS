## Business Question: Can NHS GP services achieve their patient-focused and financial goals by better utilising existing resources?

For my second project, I had the opportunity to work with real-world NHS data, a fascinating challenge that involved analysing three structured datasets on patient appointments and service performance, along with a dataset of NHS-related tweets scraped from X (formerly known as Twitter). The goal was to explore how general practitioner (GP) surgeries and other healthcare services could optimise resources to balance patient care with financial sustainability.

I tackled this project using Python, applying Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling and cleaning. I then ran descriptive and diagnostic analysis to uncover key insights into appointment trends, service efficiency, and patient usage patterns. To bring these findings to life, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear, informative visualisations that highlighted patterns in NHS service utilisation.

In addition to analysing structured NHS data, I explored how social media data could offer additional insights by analysing NHS-related tweets using Pandas and Seaborn. I extracted and visualised top healthcare hashtags (#), examined retweet and favourite counts to assess engagement, and evaluated whether this data could support decision-making for the NHS. This project reinforced the value of both traditional healthcare data and real-time social sentiment analysis in understanding public healthcare trends and service optimisation.

I documented everything in a Jupyter Notebook, put together a technical report for the NHS analytics team, and created a presentation aimed at decision-makers. This project really strengthened my ability to work with real world healthcare data and apply Python as a programming language, statistical tool, and visualisation platform. I also loved how it pushed me to think critically about datadriven decisionmaking in a sector as crucial as healthcare.
